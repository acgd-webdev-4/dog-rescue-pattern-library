  Echinocactus grusonii, popularly known as the golden barrel cactus, golden ball or mother-in-law's cushion, is a well known species of cactus, and is endemic to east-central Mexico.

  It is rare and endangered in the wild, where it is found near Mesa de León in the state of Querétaro, and in the state of Hidalgo.[1] The population was critically reduced in the 1990s, by the creation of the Zimapán Dam and reservoir in Hidalgo.
