The buttons use our secondary and tertiary colours to draw attention and stand out. Each buttons has a specific purpose.

- The default (purple) buttons are used for the product pages and forms where the background is a light color.
- The green buttons are used for a button that really needs to stand out. It may be used on banners or cards.
- The grey buttons are used on any coloured background. This would be on sections, banners, or cards. It will create a grey hue ontop of the coloured background and thus will work on any colour of background.
- The ghost buttons are used when you want a subtle link at the bottom of a section of text without a bold button. The font color of this button can be changed based on the background colour. White is used on darker coloured backgrounds and the primary colour is used on light backgrounds.

Feel free to mix them with 'font-size' classes to make different sizes of buttons.
