The buttons use the primary orange color both bright and light forms, to make them eye catching. Each button has a specific use.

-The regular button will be used for light colored background areas, cards and places where cards will be happening for the teas.
-The light buttons will be for any form of dark background areas.
-The ghost buttons should be used on banners where the background is an image.

Feel free to mix them with the 'font-size' classes to make different sizes of buttons.
