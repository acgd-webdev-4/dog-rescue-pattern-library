The buttons use the primary color both bright and light forms, to make them eye catching. Each button has a specific use.

- The regular button will be used for light colored background areas, cards.
- The light buttons will be for any form of dark background areas.
- The ghost buttons should be used on banners where the background is an image.

Feel free to mix them with the 'font-size' classes to make different sizes of buttons.
