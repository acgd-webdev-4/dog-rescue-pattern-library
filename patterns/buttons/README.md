The buttons use our secondary and tertiary colours to draw attention and stand out. Each buttons has a specific purpose.

- The regular buttons are used for the product pages and forms where the background is a light color.
- The light buttons are used for a button that really needs to stand out. It may be used on banners or cards.
- The ghost buttons are used on any coloured background. This would be on sections, banners, or cards.

Feel free to mix them with 'font-size' classes to make different sizes of buttons.
