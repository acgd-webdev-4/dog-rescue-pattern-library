  rationales:
    typefaces.primary: |
      Lato was selected because it uses classical proporations while still being sleekâ€”perfect for the prince online. Lato is to be used for all body copy.
    typefaces.secondary: |
      Roboto is to be used only in highlighting text: headers, buttons, etc.
    colors.primary: |
      The primary colours are the colours from Egg's body. They should be used for text and in the foreground.
    colors.secondary: |
      The secondary colours are the colours from Egg's crown. They should be used for minor highlights to stand out against the primary colours.
    colors.neutral: |
      The neutral colors are the light colours from Egg's body. They should be used in the background.
