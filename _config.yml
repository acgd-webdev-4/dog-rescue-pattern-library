    accent: "--color-primary-gold"
    patterns:
      brand.logos: "--color-tertiary-dark"
      brand.colours: "white"
      typography.headings: "white"
      buttons.ghost: "--color-tertiary-dark"
  rationales:
    typefaces.primary: |
      Raleway was chosen because it is great for body copy text. It is also a simple font that suits a modern/classy theme.
    typefaces.secondary: |
      Montserratwas chosen to be used fo headings. Its a bigger font, but still keeps that same modern feel.
