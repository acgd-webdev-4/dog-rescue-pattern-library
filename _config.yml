  description: |
    A small local business that specializes in a wide selection of succulents. These plant babies are perfect for indoor aesthetics which can be
    arranged in many different ways! Whether you're looking for a gift or just want to add some life into your space, these DIY terrariums are a
    fun way to create your own mini landscape.
  rationales:
    typefaces.primary: |
      Noto Sans was selected as the primary typeface because it has a consistent line thickness and height. This makes it easier for any readers to browse through
      the content without straining the eyes. This font is to be used for most of the main body copy.
    typefaces.secondary: |
      Abril Fatface was selected as the secondary typeface because of its elegant appearance. With the thin serifs and clean curves, this lends the font a refined
      touch which can relate to the delicateness and appeal of succulents. This font is to be used mostly for headings due to its decorative character.
    colors.primary: |
      The primary colors selected respresent the colors found in nature. The darker green color is to be used for headings to tie in the brand logo and content.
      The lighter green color will be used for the foreground to achieve continuity of the nature tones.
    colors.secondary: |
      The secondary color is a lighter and calmer green tone. To not overwhelm the eyes with just deep and bold greens, having a lighter green for the background will
      achieve a tranquil and calming effect to the website.
    colors.accent: |
      The accent colors selected will be used to achive consistency throughout the pages in the website. Using a different green tone slightly darker than the
      secondary will add more unity . The color white will be used to create a sense of space. White conveys feelings of freshness and simplicity
      which will complement the green colors well.
    colors.neutral: |
      The neutral color selected is more of an earthy beige tone which will continue the colors of nature.
